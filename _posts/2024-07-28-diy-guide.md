# Creating a simple blog on github pages

This morning i have been trying several ways to make a functional and simple blog hosted on this site. It's been a hustle. There aren't that many resources out there that fully explain how to make a blog like this one (or atleast it's been hard for me to find them). 

After a few tries, making a simple blog like this one is actually quite simple. You just need to follow these steps:
1. Create a github account
2. Create a new repository named: "username.github.io"
3. Clone the repository to your local machine
4. Create a ``config.yaml`` containing the following code:
###```title: My Blog
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This is my awesome blog.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://username.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
theme: minima
```
5. create a ``_layouts`` folder. Inside this, create a file named ``default.html`` with the following code:
````title: My Blog
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This is my awesome blog.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://username.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
theme: minima
````
6. create ``_posts`` folder. Inside this create posts with the following name pattern: ``YYYY-post_name.md``. The posts must also include the following header:
````

Modify the header to your needs.
7. Push content to your github repo.
