# Basic review of the memecoin meta

Crypto markets, especially the lower market cap projects, are heavily influenced by the current *meta* of the space. Currently, and for most of 2024, the meta has been memecoins.

Memecoin projects usually lack significant technological features; their value is driven by marketing. These coins are often named after celebrities but can also be about seemingly trivial themes. 

Here is a list of some topics used:
- Politicians
- Celebrities / Influencers
- Animals
- Popular memes
- Funny / random stuff

I would say the humor is mostly zoomer: [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lHKo9JYN48), [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVlspd9hxFA) (if there is any).

In this *article*, I will explain the following topics related to memecoins:
1. Trends
2. Markets
3. Trading patterns
4. Predictors

##### Memecoin trends

Although memecoins may seem trivial and unpredictable, the category operates under certain unwritten rules, and only a few projects break the mold.

##### Rule 1: Follow the trend

A few years ago, the trend was to create dog-themed coins, following the success of Dogecoin. This trend lasted several months, and thousands of dog-themed projects were created. Out of these, some succeeded in the short term, and a few still maintain good price action and active communities. The other projects were merely pump-and-dump schemes.

When the market decided that dog memecoins were no longer attractive, the meta switched to another topic. If my memory serves well, the trend that followed was cats (very original). And the cycle started again, with project developers, insiders, and influencers making lots of money, while the majority of the holders lost a lot, if not everything, they had invested.

During each of these cycles, there were some outliers. These are projects that were successful despite not following the current trend. This is usually an indicator of the end of a cycle, as the trend has lost some strength. If these outliers are very successful, they will start a new trend, likely inspired by them.

A memecoin market trend cycle typically follows this pattern:
1. A successful coin starts a trend
2. Lots of copycats are launched
3. Projects follow the topic, adding some novelty
4. (People get bored of the topic) and the trend loses strength
5. A new successful project that is different emerges
6. The cycle restarts

It is very important to understand that a trend's strength and duration are heavily influenced by the number of successful projects and the number of scams. Influencers and the *cabal* also play a huge role; if they are too greedy, casual investors lose money, stop investing, and the trend dies.

##### Rule 2: Understand the project's market

How the coins will perform and how one should invest in them depends significantly on the "market" it has been deployed on. When saying "market," I mostly refer to the blockchain. Blockchains such as Solana, Ethereum, BSC, Bitcoin (still in development), Avalanche (AVAX), Base, and more.

###### Old money vs new money

Ethereum is the most established smart contract blockchain. Its base layer has high transaction fees, so its active users usually have more money. Memecoins usually aim to attract as many users as possible, and high transaction fees are restrictive, as low investments won't be successful because of the fees. This is why most memecoin projects are launched on Solana, EVM-based blockchains, or Layer 2 solutions.

How a project is launched is also very important. Lately, there is a trend to use [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/board); although now that it is very popular, it is very difficult to find good projects there. In the crypto space, usually the best time to gain an edge on the market is in its inception, where prices are in discovery, and very experienced traders and influencers still don't have a grip on the market.

##### Rule 3: Trading shitcoins

I am not suggesting you study [TA](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex) (I don't have much confidence in its effectiveness). For crypto projects, you need to understand FA (fundamental analysis). Conducting the same type of studies as Warren Buffet will not help you in this wild market; instead, you need to study other parameters. Crypto investors refer to this type of FA as [tokenomics](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-tokenomics-d1bd30352b92) (token + economics).

There are some useful guides on the internet and on Twitter, but the best way to learn is through practice.

The crypto market is full of scams. Nowadays, we use the word 'scam' for a wide range of cases, but for this article, I will define a scam as an intentional and planned theft of investors' funds.

These are some types of scams:
- Honeypots
- Permission scams
- Manipulated price actions
- Sandwich bots
- Instant dumps
- Pump and dumps
- Exploits
- Liquidity pulls
- Insiders

There are many more types of scams, and I won't define each one, as there have been many occurrences, and you can learn about them through further research.

##### Success predictors

Success predictors come from the tokenomics of a project. The better the tokenomics, the better the chances for success.

The problem with the current memecoin meta is that there are some intrinsic factors that are very hard to analyze and incorporate into our investment plans.

Here are some of these factors:
- How funny the meme is
- Originality
- Experience of the project's team
- *Marketing* campaign
- Influencers' investment and their reputation
- Marketing reach and public attraction
- Attracting public outside the crypto space
- VC involvement (not so common)
- State of the blockchain where it is deployed
- Other current projects not getting more attention
- Involvement of the community / Active community
- State of the global crypto market
- State of the global investment markets

I believe that all of these factors influence a project's chance for success.
